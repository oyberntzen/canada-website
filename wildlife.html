              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p class="text-height mb-0">
                The wildlife of Canada is diverse, with over 80 000 recorded species, including both plants and animals. 
                Even though the number of recorded species is big, it is expected that there exist about 80 000 additional unrecorded species. 
                Human activity and global warming are reasons for many species going extinct, and today there are 800 species at risk of being lost. 
                For this reason, many national parks have been developed in Canada to protect the plants and animals. 
                There are restrictions for what you can do in the national parks, but you can still visit them to experience the wildlife. 
                However, it is recommended to learn a bit about the animals before travelling, as some of the animals can be dangerous.

              <h2>Bears</h2>
              <p class="text-height mb-0">
                There are three types of bears in Canada: black bears, grizzly bears, and polar bears. 
                Polar bears are rarely seen by people, because polar bears live in areas close to the coast far north that people rarely visit. 
                However, black bears and grizzly bears are much more common to stumble upon. 
                When meeting a bear, it is very important to not threaten the bear in any way. 
                In fact, the best thing to do is to try to avoid meeting bears altogether. 
                One way to avoid meeting a bear is to make lots of noise, as the bear will hear you and avoid you. 
                If you encounter a bear, there are some rules for what you should not do. 
                First, you should not look a bear in its eyes. 
                Second, you should not try to run or swim away from the bear, as a bear is much faster than you. 
                Third, you should not try to feed or pet the bear, this is how most bear incidents with humans occur.

              <h2>Wild Horses</h2>
              <p class="text-height mb-0">
                In Canada there are more than 1 000 wild horses, which are animals you cannot find many other places in the world. 
                However, wild horses are not recognized as wildlife in Canada. 
                Therefore, the wild horse is not recognized as species with a right remain on the land. 
                For this reason, many wild horses are killed and there are not many left still alive. 
                Many societies try to protect the wild horse with no luck, and it looks like the wild horse might become extinct.
