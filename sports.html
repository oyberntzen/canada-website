                In addition, there are many other popular sports in Canada, and tons of famous Canadian sport athletes.

              <h2>National Sports</h2>
              <h3>Ice Hockey</h3>
              <p class="text-height mb-0">
                Ice hockey started in Canada in the late 19th century. 
                The sport is played on ice with skates, and the goal of the game is to shoot the puck into the net of the other team. 
                Each team has six players and one of them is the keeper. 
                The game is split up into three periods lasting twenty minutes each. 
                The team with the most goals wins, and if it is a draw, the game will either end with no winner or continue until a team gets a goal.
              </p>
              <h3>Lacrosse</h3>
              <p class="text-height mb-0">
                Lacrosse is a sport first played by the indigenous people in North America. 
                The sport was modified by the colonizers, and it became lacrosse as we know it today. 
                There are 10 players on each team in lacrosse. 
                Each person has a stick with a small net on the end. 
                The goal is to get the ball into the other teamâ€™s goal, and this must be done by passing the ball with the stick. 
                Each game is split up into four periods lasting fifteen minutes each.

              <h3>Olympic Games</h3>
              <p class="text-height mb-0">
                Canada has competed at almost every Olympic Games. 
                At the Winter Olympic Games, Canada is often one of the nations winning the most medals. 
                Unfortunately, Canada is not doing as well in the Summer Olympic Games. 
                Canada has hosted the Olympic Games three times in 1976, 1988 and 2010. 
                We do not know yet when Canada will host their next Olympic Games, but with some luck and planning you might catch the event.
